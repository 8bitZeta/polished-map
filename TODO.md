# To Do

* **Fix:** Resizing window resets sidebar width to original zoom size (sometimes)
* Load, edit, and save custom lighting palette with .pal files
* Load, move, and save event scripts


## Maybe

* Allow undo/redo for resize operations
* Show a mini-palette of hotkeyed blocks, which the scroll wheel can cycle through
* Choose to put the sidebar on the left or right
* Choose to display coordinates as X/Y and WxH or Y/X and HxW
* Edit associated collision data
