# To Do

## Features

* Support for Mac OS X (issue [#8](https://github.com/Rangi42/polished-map/issues/8); involves publishing an app bundle release, and using the system menu bar)
* Generate map images from the command-line (issue [#10](https://github.com/Rangi42/polished-map/issues/10))
* Support event scripts (only editing the coordinates) (see: [view/edit UI concept](https://i.imgur.com/YwtFzlZ.png))

## Bug Fixes

* Resizing window resets sidebar width to original zoom size (sometimes)
* Ctrl+C/V/X when editing lighting interferes with regular cut/copy/paste somehow

## Possible Features

* Allow undo/redo for resize operations
* Show a mini-palette of hotkeyed blocks, which the scroll wheel can cycle through
* File → Open Recent → the last few opened .blk files (issue [#11](https://github.com/Rangi42/polished-map/issues/11))

## Polished Map++

A planned fork of Polished Map with support for [attribute.bin files](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/wiki/Allow-tiles-to-have-different-attributes-in-different-blocks-\(including-X-and-Y-flip\)), and assumed support for [256 tiles](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/wiki/Expand-tilesets-from-192-to-255-tiles). (See: [block editor](https://i.imgur.com/e2Qai5Y.png) and [tile editor](https://i.imgur.com/QiChqxS.png) UI concepts.)
