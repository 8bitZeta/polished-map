# To Do

* Support collision data ([edit UI concept](https://i.imgur.com/T7UrzBs.png))
* Support event scripts (only editing the coordinates) ([view/edit UI concept](https://i.imgur.com/YwtFzlZ.png))
* Allow undo/redo for resize operations
* **Fix:** Resizing window resets sidebar width to original zoom size (sometimes)
* **Fix:** Ctrl+C/V/X when editing lighting interferes with regular cut/copy/paste somehow
* *Maybe:* Show a mini-palette of hotkeyed blocks, which the scroll wheel can cycle through
* *Maybe:* Load `ROOF` palettes from roofs.pal for `TOWN` or `ROUTE` environments; based on the map group (via the guessed map constant) and environment (via the guessed tileset constant)
* *Fork:* Support [attribute.bin files](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/wiki/Allow-tiles-to-have-different-attributes-in-different-blocks-\(including-X-and-Y-flip\)) ([block](https://i.imgur.com/8Ln84ka.png) and [tile edit UI concept](https://i.imgur.com/ioziA8P.png))
