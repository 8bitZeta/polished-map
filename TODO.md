# To Do

* Auto-detect the map's tileset in data/maps/maps.asm by guessing that tileset `foo` has constant `TILESET_FOO`
* Support custom lighting palette with .pal files ([edit UI concept](https://i.imgur.com/ho1QB5m.png))
* Support collision data ([edit UI concept](https://i.imgur.com/T7UrzBs.png))
* Support event scripts (only editing the coordinates) ([view/edit UI concept](https://i.imgur.com/YwtFzlZ.png))
* Allow undo/redo for resize operations
* **Fix:** Resizing window resets sidebar width to original zoom size (sometimes)
* *Maybe:* Show a mini-palette of hotkeyed blocks, which the scroll wheel can cycle through
* *Fork:* Support [attribute.bin files](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/wiki/Allow-tiles-to-have-different-attributes-in-different-blocks-\(including-X-and-Y-flip\)) ([block](https://i.imgur.com/8Ln84ka.png) and [tile edit UI concept](https://i.imgur.com/ioziA8P.png))
