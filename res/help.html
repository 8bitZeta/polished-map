<p>A map and tileset editor for <a href="https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal">pokecrystal</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pret/pokered">pokered</a>.</p>
<p>Inspired by <a href="https://github.com/yenatch/crowdmap">crowdmap</a>, but implemented with C++ and <a href="http://www.fltk.org/">FLTK</a>, and more focused on graphics than script editing.</p>
<p>Source code is available at <a href="https://github.com/Rangi42/polished-map">https://github.com/Rangi42/polished-map</a>.</p>

<p>)" PROGRAM_NAME R"( displays and edits .blk map files. It supports all the standard ways to open a file:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Initial:</b> Double-click a .blk file in File Explorer. (Run install.bat to associate .blk files with )" PROGRAM_NAME R"(.)</li>
<li><b>Menu bar:</b> Run )" PROGRAM_EXE R"( and select the File&nbsp;→&nbsp;Open… menu item.</li>
<li><b>Toolbar:</b> Run )" PROGRAM_EXE R"( and click the Open toolbar button.</li>
<li><b>Keyboard:</b> Run )" PROGRAM_EXE R"( and press Ctrl+O.</li>
<li><b>File Explorer:</b> Drag a .blk file onto )" PROGRAM_EXE R"(.</li>
<li><b>GUI:</b> Drag a .blk file onto an open )" PROGRAM_NAME R"( window.</li>
<li><b>Command Prompt:</b> Pass the .blk filename as an argument to )" PROGRAM_EXE R"(:<br><font size="2"><kbd>)" PROGRAM_EXE "&nbsp;pokecrystal" DIR_SEP "maps" DIR_SEP R"(SomeMap.blk</kbd></font></li>
</ul>
<p>You can include a map's size and tileset in its filename as <var>MapName</var>.<var>WIDTH</var>x<var>HEIGHT</var>.<var>TILESET</var>.blk; for instance, NewBarkTown.10x9.blk, UnionCave1F.cave.blk, or House1.4x4.house.blk.</p>
<p>Otherwise )" PROGRAM_NAME R"( will try to guess a map's size and tileset from the assembly code. This can fail if the map and tileset filenames do not exactly correspond to their constants in the code. Then you'll just have to enter the size and tileset yourself.</p>
<p>Be sure to set the right options (via the Options menu) before creating or opening a map. The available options are:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Monochrome:</b> Tileset palettes will not be read or written. This option is necessary for <a href="https://github.com/pret/pokered">pokered</a>-based projects.</li>
<li><b>256 Tiles:</b> Allow all 256 tile IDs from $00 to $FF. <a href="https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal">pokecrystal</a>'s tileset graphics have tiles for IDs $00 to $5F, then skip $60 to $7F and continue from $80 to $DF, with $E0 to $FF unused. This option is necessary for projects that support larger tilesets, such as Polished Crystal and Orange.</li>
<li><b>Auto-Load Events:</b> Automatically loads the .asm file corresponding to the map if one exists. For example, if you open maps)" DIR_SEP "PalletTown.blk, then this option will automatically try to load maps" DIR_SEP "PalletTown.asm (for pokecrystal-based projects) or data" DIR_SEP "mapObjects" DIR_SEP R"(PalletTown.asm (for pokered).</li>
<li><b>Auto-Load Special Lighting:</b> Automatically loads a .pal file associated with the map if one exists. Association is based on the map, landmark, or tileset. For example, if you open maps)" DIR_SEP "IcePath1F.blk with the tileset gfx" DIR_SEP "tilesets" DIR_SEP "ice_path.png and the landmark in data" DIR_SEP "maps" DIR_SEP "maps.asm for IcePath is ICE_PATH, then this option will automatically load maps" DIR_SEP "IcePath1F.pal (corresponding to the map), or else maps" DIR_SEP "ice_path.pal (the landmark), or else gfx" DIR_SEP "tilesets" DIR_SEP R"(ice_path.pal (the tileset). You can also use File&nbsp;→&nbsp;Load&nbsp;Lighting… to manually load any such .pal file.</li>
<li><b>Auto-Load Roof Colors:</b> Automatically loads colors for the ROOF palette of the map's group, if the group was detected from constants)" DIR_SEP "map_constants.asm and the roof palettes are defined in gfx" DIR_SEP "tilesets" DIR_SEP "roofs.pal (or tilesets" DIR_SEP R"(roof.pal for backwards compatibility with older pokecrystal versions). You can also use File&nbsp;→&nbsp;Load&nbsp;Roof&nbsp;Colors to do this manually.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Most functions are available via the menu bar, the toolbar, or shortcut keys.</p>
<p>The sidebar palette uses the mouse:</p>
<ul>
<li>Left-click to select a block.</li>
<li>Right-click to edit a block.</li>
<li>Middle-click and drag to scroll.</li>
</ul>
<p>The map area also uses the mouse, but it depends on the Mode. In Block mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>Left-click or drag to place the selected block in the sidebar palette.</li>
<li>Right-click to select a block from the map.</li>
<li>Middle-click and drag to scroll.</li>
<li>Hold Shift and left-click a group of blocks to flood-fill it.</li>
<li>Hold Ctrl and left-click a block to replace every block of that type.</li>
</ul>
<p>And in Event mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>Middle-click and drag to scroll.</li>
<li>Hover over an event to see a tooltip with its full definition.</li>
</ul>
<p>The number keys 0-9 are hotkeys for the sidebar palette.</p>
<ul>
<li>Press Ctrl+0-9 to assign that key to the selected block.</li>
<li>Press 0-9 to select the block assigned to that key.</li>
<li>Press Ctrl+Shift+0-9 to unassign that key.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Block mode, you can view and edit the map's blocks. In Event mode, you can view the map's events (NPCs, warps, signs, etc) but cannot edit them directly. Instead, you can edit the events' .asm file in a text editor, and then press Ctrl+R to reload the updated file.</p>
<hr>
<p>The block editor window has some simple mouse controls:</p>
<ul>
<li>Left-click the tileset palette to select a tile.</li>
<li>Left-click or drag in the block area to place the selected tile in the block being edited.</li>
<li>Right-click to select a tile from the block.</li>
<li>Hold Ctrl and left-click to place four tiles at once: a contiguous 2x2 group, with the selected tile as the top-left.</li>
<li>Hold Ctrl+Shift and left-click to place sixteen tiles at once: a contiguous 4x4 group, with the selected tile as the top-left.</li>
</ul>
<p>For pokecrystal-based projects, you can also edit the collision values of the block's four quadrants. Old-style collision.bin files and up-to-date collision.asm files are both supported.</p>
<hr>
<p>The tileset editor window has more mouse controls, similar to the map editor:</p>
<ul>
<li>Left-click the tileset palette to select a tile.</li>
<li>Left-click a swatch, or press the 1/2/3/4 keys, to choose a hue.</li>
<li>Left-click or drag the tile pixels to draw with the chosen hue in the selected tile.</li>
<li>Right-click to choose a hue from the tile.</li>
<li>Hold Shift and left-click a group of pixels to flood-fill it.</li>
<li>Hold Ctrl and left-click a pixel to replace every pixel of that hue.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, and Ctrl+X will copy, paste, and swap tiles respectively, just like they do for blocks in the map editor's sidebar palette. Delete will clear a tile's graphics and set its color to UNDEFINED.</p>
<p>Every tile has a single color. The TEXT color is meant for menus and text boxes, and should not be used for map tiles. The "<span>Priority (above sprites)</span>" checkbox sets the PRIORITY attribute bit for a tile so it will appear above sprites, including NPCs and the player; this is <a href="https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/wiki/Allow-map-tiles-to-appear-above-sprites-(so-NPCs-can-walk-behind-tiles)-with-PRIORITY-colors">a feature</a> of Polished Crystal and similar hacks.</p>
<hr>
<p>Tilesets can be augmented by roofs. A roof is assumed to take up the nine tiles from $0A to $12. When a roof is loaded, it visibly affects the map and the block editor, but not the tileset editor. Thus you can edit the tileset without the loaded roof overwriting those nine tiles.</p>
<p>When you open a map the roof selection always defaults to none, even if the map uses a roof. This is because pokecrystal only loads roofs for certain tilesets, which are <a href="https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal/wiki/Hard-coded-logic#tilesets-that-have-per-mapgroup-roofs">hard-coded</a> instead of being defined in a data table. This makes it impractical to automatically detect a map's roof type, so you'll have to manually specify it.</p>
<p>The roof editor window is similar to the tileset editor. However, it does not support Delete.</p>
<hr>
<p>The colors' exact appearance depends on the current lighting: MORN, DAY, NITE, INDOOR, or CUSTOM. The default set of lighting colors is based on pokecrystal, but custom ones will be read from gfx)" DIR_SEP "tilesets" DIR_SEP "bg_tiles.pal (or tilesets" DIR_SEP R"(bg.pal for backwards compatibility with older pokecrystal versions) if it exists.</p>
<p>When a map <var>MapName</var>.blk is opened with the tileset <var>tileset</var>.png, )" PROGRAM_NAME R"( will automatically load <var>tileset</var>.pal if it exists, and <var>MapName</var>.pal if it exists. If the map is part of the <var>LANDMARK</var> landmark, it will automatically load <var>landmark</var>.pal if it exists. This is convenient for maps like Ice Path with custom palettes. This can be disabled via Options&nbsp;→&nbsp;Auto-Load&nbsp;Special&nbsp;Lighting.</p>
<p>In the lighting editor, Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, and Ctrl+X will copy, paste, and swap colors respectively, just like they do for blocks and tiles in their own editor dialogs.</p>
<p>Edited lighting colors can be exported, but only one at a time; so if you load a multi-lighting .pal file (like bg_tiles.pal, which defines MORN, DAY, NITE, and INDOOR lighting colors), do not overwrite it when exporting your edits.</p>
