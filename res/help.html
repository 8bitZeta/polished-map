<h1>Polished Map</h1>
<p>Copyright © 2017 Rangi</p>
<p>A map and tileset editor for <a href="https://github.com/roukaour/polishedcrystal">Pokémon Polished Crystal</a>.</p>
<p>Inspired by <a href="https://github.com/yenatch/crowdmap">crowdmap</a>, but implemented with C++ and <a href="http://www.fltk.org/">FLTK</a>, and focused on graphics instead of script editing.</p>
<p>Source code is available at <a href="https://github.com/roukaour/polished-map">https://github.com/roukaour/polished-map</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Polished Map displays and edits .blk map files. It supports all the standard ways to open a file:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Initial:</b> Double-click a .blk file in File Explorer. (Run install.bat to associate .blk files with Polished Map.)</li>
<li><b>Menu bar:</b> Run polishedmap.exe and select the File&nbsp;→&nbsp;Open… menu item.</li>
<li><b>Toolbar:</b> Run polishedmap.exe and click the Open toolbar button.</li>
<li><b>Keyboard:</b> Run polishedmap.exe and press Ctrl+O.</li>
<li><b>File Explorer:</b> Drag a .blk file onto polishedmap.exe.</li>
<li><b>GUI:</b> Drag a .blk file onto an open Polished Map window.</li>
<li><b>Command Prompt:</b> Pass the .blk filename as an argument to polishedmap.exe:<br><font size="2"><kbd>polishedmap.exe&nbsp;C:\pokecrystal\maps\SomeMap.blk</kbd></font></li>
</ul>
<p>Polished Map will try to guess a map's size and tileset. You can append them to the filename as <kbd>.<var>WIDTH</var>x<var>HEIGHT</var></kbd> or <kbd>.<var>WIDTH</var>x<var>HEIGHT</var>.<var>TILESET</var></kbd>; for instance, NewBarkTown.10x9.blk or UnionCave1F.10x18.24.blk. Otherwise Polished Map will guess the map's constant ID from its filename and read its size from the assembly code; for instance, UnionCaveB2F.blk is guessed to be <code>UNION_CAVE_B2F</code>. This can fail, like when LakeofRage.blk is guessed as <code>LAKEOF_RAGE</code>. Then you'll just have to enter the size yourself.</p>
<p>Be sure to set the right options (via the Options menu) before creating or opening a map. The available options are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Monochrome: Palettes will not be read or written. This is appropriate for <a href="https://github.com/pret/pokered">pokered</a>-based projects.</li>
<li>Skip Tiles $60 to $7F: Tileset graphics have tiles for IDs $00 to $5F, then skip $60 to $7F and continue from $80 to $DF. This is appropriate for <a href="https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal">pokecrystal</a>-based projects, including Prism and Axyllia. Polished Crystal and Orange support <a href="https://hax.iimarckus.org/topic/7167/">larger tilesets</a>, using any tile ID from $00 to $FF.</li>
<li>Tile Priority: Palettes can use <samp>PRIORITY_*</samp> color constants to make tiles appear above sprites. This is appropriate for Polished Crystal, Orange, or any pokecrystal hack that <a href="https://hax.iimarckus.org/topic/7268/">enables tile priority</a>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Most functions are available via the menu bar, the toolbar, or shortcut keys.</p>
<p>The sidebar palette uses the mouse:</p>
<ul>
<li>Left-click to select a block.</li>
<li>Right-click to edit a block.</li>
<li>Middle-click and drag to scroll.</li>
</ul>
<p>The map area also uses the mouse:</p>
<ul>
<li>Left-click or drag to place the selected block in the sidebar palette.</li>
<li>Right-click to select a block from the map.</li>
<li>Middle-click and drag to scroll.</li>
<li>Hold Shift and left-click a group of blocks to flood-fill it.</li>
<li>Hold Ctrl and left-click a block to replace every block of that type.</li>
</ul>
<p>The number keys 0-9 are hotkeys for the sidebar palette.</p>
<ul>
<li>Press Ctrl+0-9 to assign that key to the selected block.</li>
<li>Press 0-9 to select the block assigned to that key.</li>
<li>Press Ctrl+Shift+0-9 to unassign that key.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>The block editor window has some simple mouse controls:</p>
<ul>
<li>Left-click the tileset palette to select a tile.</li>
<li>Left-click or drag in the block area to place the selected tile in the block being edited.</li>
<li>Right-click to select a tile from the block.</li>
<li>Hold Ctrl and left-click to place four tiles at once: a contiguous 2x2 group, with the selected tile as the top-left.</li>
<li>Hold Ctrl+Shift and left-click to place sixteen tiles at once: a contiguous 4x4 group, with the selected tile as the top-left.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>The tileset editor window has more mouse controls, similar to the map editor:</p>
<ul>
<li>Left-click the tileset palette to select a tile.</li>
<li>Left-click a swatch, or press the 1/2/3/4 keys, to choose a hue.</li>
<li>Left-click or drag the tile pixels to draw with the chosen hue in the selected tile.</li>
<li>Right-click to choose a hue from the tile.</li>
<li>Hold Shift and left-click a group of pixels to flood-fill it.</li>
<li>Hold Ctrl and left-click a pixel to replace every pixel of that hue.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, and Ctrl+X will copy, paste, and swap tiles respectively, just like they do for blocks in the map editor's sidebar palette. Delete will clear a tile's graphics and set its color to UNDEFINED.</p>
<p>Every tile has a single color. The TEXT color is meant for menus and text boxes, and should not be used for map tiles. The "Priority" checkbox sets the priority bit for a tile so it will appear above sprites, including NPCs and the player; this is <a href="https://hax.iimarckus.org/topic/7268/">a feature</a> of Polished Crystal and similar hacks.</p>
