# Polished Map

A map and tileset editor for [Pok√©mon Polished Crystal](https://github.com/roukaour/polishedcrystal).

Inspired by [crowdmap](https://github.com/yenatch/crowdmap), but implemented with C++ and [FLTK](http://www.fltk.org/), and focused on graphics instead of script editing.

Latest release: [**2.1.1**](https://github.com/roukaour/polished-map/releases/tag/v2.1.1)

Follow the three steps in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) to install the release copy of Polished Map, or the longer instructions to build it yourself from source.

If you get an error that "mscvrt120.dll is missing", you need to install the [Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784).
