# Polished Map

A map and tileset editor for [Pok√©mon Polished Crystal](https://github.com/roukaour/polishedcrystal).

Inspired by [crowdmap](https://github.com/yenatch/crowdmap), but implemented with C++ and [FLTK](http://www.fltk.org/), and focused on graphics instead of script editing.

Latest release: [**2.2.1**](https://github.com/roukaour/polished-map/releases/tag/v2.2.1)

Follow the steps in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) to install the release copy of Polished Map, or the longer instructions to build it yourself from source.
