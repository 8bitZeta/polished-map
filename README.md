# Polished Map

A map and tileset editor for [Pokémon Polished Crystal](https://github.com/roukaour/polishedcrystal) that also works for [pokecrystal](https://github.com/pret/pokecrystal), [pokered](https://github.com/pret/pokered), [Prism](https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonPrism/), and [Axyllia](http://pokemonfractal.wikia.com/wiki/Axyllia).

Inspired by [crowdmap](https://github.com/yenatch/crowdmap), but implemented with C++ and [FLTK](http://www.fltk.org/), and focused on graphics instead of script editing.

Latest release: [**3.0.7**](https://github.com/roukaour/polished-map/releases/tag/v3.0.7)

Follow the steps in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) to install the release copy of Polished Map, or the longer instructions to build it yourself from source.

You can try opening [example/maps/Kanto.180x135.kanto.blk](example/maps/Kanto.180x135.kanto.blk) as a **pokecrystal 2018** project. It's a stitch of every Kanto overworld map from pokecrystal, since they use the same tileset. [example/maps/Johto.235x135.johto_1.blk](example/maps/Johto.235x135.johto_1.blk) is a stitch of every Johto overworld map; a few of them used tileset johto_2, so try switching tilesets with **Edit→Change Tileset…** or by pressing Ctrl+H.
